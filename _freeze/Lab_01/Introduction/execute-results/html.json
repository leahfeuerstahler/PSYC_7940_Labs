To do so, you can run this code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"tinytex\")\ntinytex::install_tinytex()\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou may be prompted to install \"git\" using command line developer tools or Rtools. If so, follow the instructions printed on your screen.\n\n## Compile to PDF or Word\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n## Quarto\n\nUse Quarto if it works on your computer.\n\n1.  Open a file: File $\\rightarrow$ New File $\\rightarrow$ Quarto Document\n\n2.  Select “Document” in the leftmost panel.\n\n3.  Select \"PDF\" or \"Word\" as the output format and click \"Create\".\n\n4.  A template Quarto document will be opened in RStudio. Click \"Render\" or File $\\rightarrow$ Render Document. Save the file first.\n\n5.  If successful, a Word or PDF file should appear in the same folder in which you saved the file.\n\n## R Markdown\n\nR Markdown is older than Quarto. Only use this option if Quarto gives errors (e.g., Quarto files don't render on Windows computers with ARM processors).\n\n1.  Open a new file: File $\\rightarrow$ New File $\\rightarrow$ R Markdown\n\n2.  Select “Document” in the leftmost panel.\n\n3.  Select \"PDF\" or \"Word\" as the output format and click \"OK\".\n\n4.  A template R Markdown document will be opened in RStudio. Click \"Knit\" or File $\\rightarrow$ Knit Document. Save the file first.\n\n5.  If successful, a Word or PDF file should appear in the same folder in which you saved the file.\n:::\n\n## Introduction to `ggplot2`\n\nPlotting is an essential component in this class. We will use \n\n-   `ggplot2` is a R package which is part of the `tidyverse`.\n\n-   If you have already installed `tidyverse`, you can use `ggplot2`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   In this lab, we will focus on plotting with `ggplot2`. Even though it is not always the best solution, it is well-integrated with the other packages that we will us for Bayesian statistics and it is user-friendly. If you prefer, you may instead use basic R tools to make plots in the assignments.\n\n## `stan` and `brms`\n\n-   `stan` is a command-line program for statistical modeling that is currently the best for general-purpose Bayesian computation.\n\n-   Most users interact with `stan` through integrations with programming languages like `R` or `python`. \n\n-   In this class, we will primarily interact with `stan` through the `brms` package in `R`. A major advantage of `brms` is that its syntax is similar to `lm()`.\n\n- For example: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Ordinary regression:\nlm(outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2)\n\n# Bayesian regression with brms:\nbrm(outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2)\n```\n:::\n\n\n`brms` calls another `R` integration to `stan`: `rstan`.\n\n## `rstan`\n\nTo install, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)\n\n* Windows users: with latest version of `R`, make sure that you install **RTools 4.5** instead of an earlier version.\n\n* Close and re-open your RStudio session before verifying the installation.\n\nTo verify your installation:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexample(stan_model, package = \"rstan\", run.dontrun = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou might see a long list of scary messages and it may take a long time. If successful, the last few lines should look like this:\n\n```\nChain 4: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4:\nChain 4:  Elapsed Time: 0.003 seconds (Warm-up)\nChain 4:                0.003 seconds (Sampling)\nChain 4:                0.006 seconds (Total)\nChain 4:\n```\n\n## `brms`\n\nRemember: `brms` references `rstan` but is more user-friendly.\n\nRun the following code to install `brms`. You may be prompted to install additional build tools. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"brms\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nRun the following code. If your `brms` installation was successful, the output should end with something similar to what is shown on the previous slide.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(brms)\nbrm(zAge ~ zBase, data = epilepsy)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Today's Activity\n\n-   Install R, ggplot2 and `brms`.\n\n-   Use the examples in this lab to verify correct installation.\n\n-   To receive participation credit for today, verify with lab instructor that `brms` works successfully on your computer and that you can compile a document to Word or PDF using RStudio.\n\n    - If needed, you can arrange to resolve installation issues during office hours.\n\n-   It is extremely important that you successfully complete these steps to be able to participate in the rest of the semester.
